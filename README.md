# Keka Log Duration by Jp

**Keka Log Duration by Jp** is a Tampermonkey user script that improves the usability of the Keka platform by automating log duration calculations and displaying total log-in time. This script is perfect for users who want to quickly track their attendance log durations without manual calculations.

## Features

## How It Works

### Key Functionalities:

1. **Calculate Duration**:
   - Automatically computes the difference between start and end times.
   - Displays durations for each log entry.

2. **Calculate Total Duration**:
   - Aggregates durations of all log entries for the day.
   - Displays the total duration at the bottom of the log modal.

   - Listens to user interactions and updates the durations dynamically.

4. **Visual Effects**:
   - Adds a morphing text effect to display engaging messages at the top of the page.

## Example

### Before:
- Manually calculate durations between log-in and log-out times.
- No visibility of total duration for the day.

### After:
- **Log Durations**: `2 Hr 15 Min` displayed dynamically next to each log.
- **Total Duration**: `7 Hr 45 Min` displayed clearly at the bottom.
- **Enhanced UI**: Morphing text adds an engaging element to the page.
